      <p>
        <span class="">Director of Risk Management These days almost every REALTOR® has a website, and many REALTORS® advertise listings on websites such as Craigslist, Zillow, Trulia, etc.  However, not every REALTOR® is aware that the N.A.R. Code of Ethics and the MLS Rules &amp; Regulations were amended in recent years to address the issue of electronic advertisement of listings by REALTORS® other than the true listing agent.  </span>

      <p>
        <span class="">The “Code”: </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">The association has seen a steady rise in the number of ethics com-plaints which have been filed by list-ing agents who allege that another REALTOR® is advertising listings on the internet without the permission of the listing agent.  In 2007, Article 12 of the Code of Ethics - which requires REALTORS® to present a “true picture” in advertising - was revised to include duties relating to electronic advertis-ing.   </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">The Code of Ethics, Standard of Practice 12-4 states, “REALTORS® shall not offer for sale/lease or advertise property without authority.”  Simply, no REALTOR® may advertise another </span>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <span class="">agent’s listing without prior authoriza-tion from the listing agent. There are additional Articles of the Code and Standards of Practice which may also apply when an advertising violation is alleged.  Discipline may include fines payable to the associa-tion, mandatory education, letters of warning/reprimand, or combinations thereof.  Multiple violations of the Code may result in suspension of or expulsion from REALTOR® member-ship. </span>

      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Our multiple listing service (MLS) Sandicor, is also receiving a high vol-ume of complaints concerning mem-bers who are advertising other mem-bers’ listings without obtaining the required prior written consent of the listing broker.  As with many rules for Sandicor Participants, there is an MLS rule which mirrors the REALTOR® Code of Ethics.  Sandicor MLS Rule 12.8 states, “A listing shall not be adver-tised by any participant or subscriber other than the listing broker, without the prior written consent of the listing broker…”  A violation of this MLS rule may result in a $500.00 fine per listing In addition, the MLS Rules &amp; </span>

    <div>
      <p>
        <span class="">Regulations have additional require-ments regarding listing attributions, IDX displays, display purpose, etc.  Please make sure you’re “up to Code” and following the rules by reviewing your advertising materials, including those appearing on internet sites such as Craigslist and Zillow.
