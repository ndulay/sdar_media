With the turbulent economic times, our industry has become a target for additional monetary resources for our government, i.e., mortgage interest deduction being threatened and the implementation of local business tax fees for individual real estate agents, etc. My leadership philosophy translates to allowing the knowledge, experience and input of others to be used for the greater good of all.  It also has been reflected in my willingness to speak out about issues that are significant to our members.  My background in organiz-ing and serving as a labor union presi-dent for a major corporation trained me to make myself available, listen to mem-bers needs and provide the solutions (education, information, resources) to represent and protect the best interests of our industry and membership.  It also instilled in me the recognition for the need of a collective voice to be heard and not one of personal interests or gain.  The betterment and success of our organization and industry will be my personal gain. </span>

Current political issues demand that we actively involve ourselves and be heard as a powerful voice within our city, state, and country…especially with the current threats facing our industry, including; proposed restrictive home financing when needed for stablizing homeownership, losing mortgage inter-est deductions, the short sale/REO pro-cess, and the lack of many HOAs’ coop-eration with our transactions…some-thing I am currently working on for the benefit of all REALTORS®. </span>

        <span class="">We have witnessed and experienced the devastation of the credibility of our industry by greed and unethical prac-tices.

      <p>
        <span class="">For twenty five years I was a working full time REALTOR® representing buy-ers and sellers of residential, office and multi-family investment properties in San Diego. Since 2005 I have simulta-neously managed two very different offices for Willis Allen Real Estate. The markets we serve are quite unique as are the personalities and styles of the REALTORS® I work for. I mentor, train, support, advise, learn from and care for a dynamic group of REALTORS®.  I have an excellent understanding of the chal-lenges we are facing together. My vol-unteer service to SDAR is recent, broad based and committed: • 2009 SDAR Office Manager of the Year • 2010/2011 SDAR Director • SDAR Grievance Committee 2008 – 2010 • SDAR Grievance Committee Chair 2010 • SDAR Budget and Finance Committee Vice Chair 2011 </span>

        <span class="">Everything is changing. The consumer has changed. Technology evolves not just on a daily basis but literally in min-utes. The business climate is different. We need to be thinking and planning strategically. There is so much informa-tion flowing that the key to maintaining relevance will be our knowledge.  SDAR must be a dynamic forward-thinking source of that knowledge for our mem-bers and in turn they need to be that reliable source for the buyers and sellers of real estate in San Diego. </span>

We are problem solv-ers, entrepreneurs and optimists. We are the backbone of volunteer community and youth organizations. I am proud to be a career REALTOR®. I have done my homework, am prepared and would be honored to represent you as San Diego Association of REALTORS® Vice President in 2012. </span>
