        </span>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <span class="">As an active volunteer in the Association for many years, a number of fellow volunteers have asked me to seek the office of Vice President. I appreciate that past Presidents, cur-rent Officers, and Directors have rec-ommended that I pursue this office. I have learned a great deal from serv-ing the members at the Association over the years. I take this opportunity seriously and look forward to the chal-lenges this position holds. </span>

      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <span class="">The role of an officer requires a great deal of diverse experience. My back-ground as the Accounting Controller for several corporations provided for management of personnel in various capacities and responsibilities, and having owned two small companies in the past and one currently, adds a greater scope of understanding as to what is required to run an opera-tion such as SDAR. Within SDAR, I have twice served as Director, for-merly a Director for C.A.R, have served on committees such and Budget and Finance, Investment Management Trustees, Real Estate Trustees, Bylaws, Government Affairs, been involved with several Strategic Planning groups, and participated on numer-ous task forces. My Chair and Vice-Chair experience has been valuable in learning more about the depth of the Association. Good communica-tion and being able to work well with others is fundamental to our indus-try and the same holds true within the Association. My leadership and management experience gives great-er opportunity for communication between the REALTORS® in the field, the staff that operate SDAR, and the volunteers that lead the Association. </span>

        </span>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <span class="">The key challenges I see are related to property taxes, zoning rights, tech-nological progress, and maintaining ethics within our industry. The rights we have attached to property owner-</span>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <span class="">ship in this country are nearly unique throughout the world. These rights give us a significant portion of our wealth and freedom.  Burdensome taxation, increasing fees, future access to water rights, unreasonable land-use restrictions, unsupportable local envi-ronmental concerns, and down zoning are just some of the current and future issues that affect property values and our ability to practice real estate with-in San Diego County. Being active as individuals and as an Association at all political levels will be the solution to maintaining our ownership rights. As technology changes and grows, we as REALTORS® need to always be on the leading edge. It has been long sup-posed that websites and automation will remove the individual from the transaction. People will always need others when it comes to service and our industry is no different. We do need however, to always make every effort to plan for and take advantage of, any tools that become available to us – on every level. Proper strategic planning is important in this regard. Lastly, maintaining ethics is crucial to our industry. Greater levels of educa-tion, increased internal monitoring of REALTOR® activities, and repercussions for inappropriate or unacceptable con-duct are fundamental for maintaining and increasing our reputation with our clients. Other challenges will certain arrive and with a healthy Association looking out for our best interests, we can meet those challenges. </span>

          <strong> What effect has your SDAR member-ship had on your career and what will you do to make SDAR more effective for members? </strong>
        </span>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <span class="">I became involved with SDAR through then President, Sheryl Betyar. She invited me to become involved in one committee and after a while, I soon recognized all the non-tangible benefits of becoming involved with such a well respected organization. My membership with SDAR has certainly added to my reputation of being a true professional in the real estate industry. Not all real estate or other industry associations offer the scope, breadth, or knowledge that SDAR provides to its members. The role of Vice President is important for making SDAR even more effective as this position requires frequent contact with our REALTOR® members – by attending caravans, office meetings of the various com-panies, etc. If SDAR is not effective for you, then I will hear about it! In communicating with and pursuing the best interests of our membership, I will fulfill my responsibilities for you as Vice President. I look forward to serv-ing you as Vice President for 2012. </span>
