    <div>
      <p>
        <span class="">Being a REALTOR® since 1988 and a continuous volunteer nearly all that time except during a brief recall to active duty following 9/11, I have experienced several market swings.  My experience and passion to my industry has placed me at the right place at the right time to lead our association during a recovery from one of the most challenging and difficult real estate markets in San Diego history. </span>
      </p>
    </div>

      <p>
        <span class="">
          <strong>What skills and experience do you bring to this position? </strong>
        </span>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <span class="">As I move closer to the 25-year mark in my business, I realize two important things: </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">1. What matters most is the relation-ship-building we do every day. 2. How we treat others throughout our careers.  </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">My 20-plus years of volunteerism at SDAR include REALTOR® Attorney Committee (chair), Grievance Committee (chair), Events Committee (chair), EVP Task Force Committee, Professional Standards Committee (chair), Budget &amp; Finance, Information Technology Committee, Strategic Planning (several times), SANDICOR Board of Directors (SDAR representative), CAR Board of Directors (past 5 years), SDAR Board of Director (three times), and Vice President of SDAR (once).  The breadth of my SDAR and CAR experience positions me well to serve and lead our association.  I have served in the United States Navy for 30 years operating in small specialized teams.  Those who know me know I have integrity and will work tire-lessly to build consensus to achieve the objective.  My balance comes from my family, where I spend my off time coach-ing soccer and Little League, serving as Presidio Little League president the last two years, where we made remark-able improvements to facilities and pro-grams. The future is our youth, and I encourage all around me to spend time with a child.  The reward is priceless. </span>

      <p>
        <span class="">Our near-term challenges will remain in zero equity properties, or short sales. Until lenders can better coordinate their efforts to work side by side with our </span>

        <span class="">industry to assist homeowners in escap-ing their loan obligations, we will have all the difficulties and challenges that come with helping our clients who are overleveraged in this market. Another very critical challenge is the control of our information by those out-side our industry who want tomanipulate and sell it back to us.  Our approach to both issues will need to be addressed for the benefit of our members and clients. Also, when many in our industry are experiencing setbacks and challenges they never could have envisioned four or five years ago, our leadership at the State and National levels are postur-ing to raise our membership fees.  My commitment to you will be to make our voice heard regarding no new fees. </span>

    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <span class="">We are so lucky to live in San Diego and be part of one of the largest Association of REALTORS® in the nation. SDAR has given me the opportunity to meet other professional REALTORS® all over San Diego County, the state, and the country.  Exchanging ideas, informa-tion, and client leads helps one grow and see beyond the obvious.  SDAR has built a solid foundation through good leadership and the hard work of dedi-cated volunteers and staff.  For example, the Risk Management department is by far one of the best in the country and well ahead of most with proac-tively creating forms that help us daily, Government Affairs has forged relation-ships with leaders at all levels of govern-ment.  This is a true benefit when facing legislature that may pose difficulty to our members and clients.  If elected, I would be honored to carry the torch to the next level for a better and even stronger San Diego Association of REALTORS®.  I would be humbled and honored to have your vote. Thank you. </span>
