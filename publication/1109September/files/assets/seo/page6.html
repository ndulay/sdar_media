        <span class="">By Jacqueline A. Oliver, Esq. The duties of a real estate licensee do not include giving legal advice; how-ever, it is easy to get “trapped” unex-pectedly when clients ask you about their rights and obligations. Almost any answer is legal advice. Attorneys, not real estate agents, provide opinions on “rights and obligations.” </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">The best way to avoid the “trap” is: 1) to be prepared with a response and 2) to truly understand your role as a real estate agent, (i.e., know what you are supposed to be doing in the first place.) This article focuses on how real estate agents can avoid the dangers of giving legal advice—either intention-ally or innocently. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">A real estate licensee has limited duties which do not include “inter-preting” contracts, that is, determin-ing the rights and obligations of the parties to a contract. You might ask yourself “how do I do my job if I can’t tell the client what their rights and responsibilities are?” Unfortunately, the answer is complicated. Your role in the transaction might be to assist Sellers in marketing and selling real property or to assist Buyers in locating and purchasing real property. Sounds </span>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <span class="">simple, right? Not really. As you well know, a real estate agent’s job is com-plex. The more you focus on your own role, the less likely you are to take on someone else’s role—i.e., the attorney. Consider the following questions you might hear from a client. Can we cancel the contract? Can we keep the buyer’s deposit? Can I change my financing terms? Any response could constitute a legal opinion. For exam-ple, the consequences to a party can-celling a contract depend on which party wants to cancel, the availabil-ity of contingencies and the default remedies. In practice, it is best to tell your client that cancelling a contract may result in legal consequences and, since you do not give legal advice, you recommend they consult an attor-ney to answer their legal questions. Confirm this advice in writing. (See “Confirmation Letters” on the SDAR website under Risk Management.) Another example of how agents fall into the trap of giving legal advice is when their client says “I don’t have an attorney and can’t afford, or don’t want to pay for, legal advice.” The response should be “You can contact the Lawyer’s Referral Service in San Diego and get 30 minutes of free advice from </span>

    <div>
      <p>
        <span class="">an experienced real estate attorney.” Confirm this in a quick email and be sure to include the phone number to LRIS which is (619) 231-8585. If you know the limits to your duties and really understand the contract you are using, you can be ready with an appropriate response to questions which trigger legal advice. Basic risk management protocol begins with determining the type of transaction, that is, whether it is a sale, purchase, lease, and whether it is residential or commercial. Then select the appropri-ate contract which fits the transaction. Using the wrong contract can result in liability since you are supposed to know which contract to use. If in doubt, remember to use the Forms Advisor®. As an example, you should not list vacant land using a Residential Listing Agreement nor should you use the Residential Purchase Agreement (RPA) for multi-unit income property when the Residential Income Purchase Agreement (RIPA) is more suitable to the transaction. To improve your skills, look to your resources such as addi-tional real estate education courses, your broker, your manager, Forms Advisor®, and the CAR website. After selecting the appropriate con-tract, complete it correctly and leave the legal questions to the client’s own attorney. Although, the California Association of REALTORS® standard-ized forms (Zipforms6®) include a dis-claimer that REALTORS® do not give legal advice, it is prudent to pay atten-tion to the particular circumstances and, when necessary, give additional recommendations to your client about the need to consult with an attorney. For this reason, confirmation letters work well to memorialize in writing that 1) you do not give legal advice and 2) you recommend the client con-sult with legal counsel. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">In regard to disputes, be sure to tell your clients whether the contract requires mediation prior to filing an action, i.e. “automatic mediation.” While mediation is often “automatic,” arbitration is generally a negotiable term which carries legal consequences such as giving up one’s constitutional right to a jury trial. The CAR web-site (www.car.org) and the Real Estate </span>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <span class="">Mediation Center website (www.real-estatemediationcenter.com) include valuable information explaining both mediation and arbitration and the dif-ferences. If you are not familiar with these words, go to those websites to educate yourself today because you should know what they mean. Unfortunately, not all attorneys recognize that most CAR contracts require mediation before filing an action. A party’s failure to mediate before filing an action could result in their losing the ability to recover attorney fees—a benefit often avail-able to the prevailing party. Be sure to advise your clients to consult with legal counsel if a dispute arises between the parties. Point them to the paragraph in the contract on “Dispute Resolution” (paragraph 23 in the RPA, for instance). If the contract provides for automatic mediation, be sure to remind your client to mention this to their attorney. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">A common mistake that agents make is to consult with their own attorney about the client’s legal ques-tions. Your attorney will likely tell you not to give legal advice. However, your attorney may not realize that you intend to share their advice with your client. The mistake is giving your cli-ent the legal advice that your attorney gave you. BEWARE: This constitutes unauthorized practice of law by YOU. The client must contact their own attorney for advice; legal advice can-not come from you. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Finally, when faced with a legal question, the best practice is to be ready to respond that you do not give legal advice and strongly recommend your clients consult with their own attorney. Whether the client actually contacts an attorney is always a mys-tery so remember to create a paper trail of confirmation letters to prove your advice to your client to consult an attorney. </span>
