        <span class="">Security is critical to every organization but when businesses face budget con-straints, needed security improvements or maintenance of existing systems are often postponed.  This can cause difficulty when it comes to security enforcement and man-agement.  Fortunately, there is a better way to manage security challenges.  Siemens offers Remote Security Management (RSM), a cost-effective solution that leverages existing security technologies while cut-ting capital and operational expenditures.  Remote Security Management leverages the Software as a Service (SaaS) model. SaaS solutions are becoming more com-mon place; from email, contact relationship management tools, even online banking. For security, an RSM provider hosts the head-end software and servers for video and access control systems that would oth-erwise be installed or hosted at the busi-</span>

        <span class="">ness location.  As a SaaS offering, Property Managers or Owners can have complete transparency to security issues through a web-portal.  These web-based solutions minimize upfront capital investments and reduces IT expenses.  </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Property managers will find that RSM aids in reducing false alarms, managing multiple locations and can augment some of the tasks otherwise performed by outsourced guards.  Remote security management allows for the verification of alarms when they happen.  Intrusion or Access Control alarms can be validated by checking on the area in question through the video surveil-lance system.  Visual verification is becom-ing mandatory in many cities and towns in order to minimize sending first responders to a location when it is not warranted.  This is costly for the municipality and in order to recuperate funds, the building owner or </span>

    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <span class="">operator is typically charged a false alarm fee.  RSM greatly minimizes false alarms and the fees associated with them. RSM also enables a business to better manage multiple locations.  This solution is more cost effective than on-site systems that require servers and software at each location.  It eliminates the need to have maintenance and upgrades of these sys-tems; making it less costly and less complex to operate.  A secure connection via the internet allows RSM solutions to be a viable solution for property managers.  Services like Remote Access Management or RAM, also allows Property Managers to provide access to tenants, visitors or contractors remotely.  If someone forgets their access card and a receptionist or manager is not available to assist on-site, access can be granted via the web-portal. </span>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <span class="">Additionally, RSM helps to reduce costs by augmenting tasks performed by security guards.  For example, RSM services such as Video Guard Tours can replace the cost of a guard walking a property to ensure that all is as it should be.  By leveraging the video from cameras systems, these same tasks can be performed remotely at sched-uled intervals or on an as-needed basis. Property Managers find this service particu-larly useful at more remote locations where guards are not regularly staffed, or during off hours.  By reducing the number of hours guards are required, one can reduce their overall spend. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Remote Security Management from Siemens is the optimal solution for busi-nesses that want comprehensive video and access control solutions but do not have the budget or expertise to administer, man-age or monitor these systems.  </span>
