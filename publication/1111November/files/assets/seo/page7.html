        <span class="">What could be more exciting after Halloween than the November C.A.R. Forms Update/Release?  Your C.A.R. Standard Forms Advisory Committee (SFAC) has been busy and some new and revised forms are scheduled for release on November 28.  There are quite a few important and helpful changes you need to know about. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">First, really good news for agents who handle short sale listings:  The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) decided in July that it will not enforce the Mortgage Assistance Relief Services (MARS) rules provided the agents meet three criteria: 1. The agents are licensed and main-tain good standing under state law. 2. They are acting in compliance with state law governing the practices of brokers and agents. 3. They are assisting or attempting to assist a consumer in negotiat-ing, obtaining or arranging a short sale of a dwelling in the course of securing the sale of the consumer’s home. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">You might recall from my last update, the MARS rules had precipitated the release of four C.A.R. forms created to help agents comply with the FTC rules. The forms will remain available for those who feel compelled to use them (read: really like government regulation and forms), but the rest of us won’t have to. Second, as a result of a court decision earlier this year, the C.A.R. Independent Contractor Agreement (ICA) arbitration clause has been modified.  A new form with updated language was released several months ago.  C.A.R. also released an ICA Addendum that can be used to modify previous version of the ICA.  If you have an interest in the legal issues involved you will find a discussion at http://www.car.org/media/pdf/legal/ standard-forms/565809/. There are quite a few “housekeep-ing” changes to the C.A.R. Forms in this release and in order not to bore those of you with a limited attention span (you know who you are) I am only going to address the forms with significant changes.  The complete summary of the changes can be found at http:// www.car.org/legal/standard-forms/ summary-forms-releases-chart/novem-ber2011formreleases/ . </span>

If you are interested, I can provide you with a copy of the draft form for your input. Not to be outdone, the SDAR Risk Management Committee has updated the SDAR Addendum to the Purchase Agreement (APA) to remove items that are now included in the C.A.R. forms library.  And, an update to the Local Area Disclosure Form (LAD) will be available shortly on the SDAR website (look under Membership/Education then Risk Management for all SDAR Risk Management Forms.  The main change to the LAD was the addition of a new paragraph on Gas Pipelines. As always, any suggestions youhave for C.A.R. forms should be sent to Carforms@ car.org.  C.A.R.’s liaison to the SFAC (Joy Alafia) will ensure your suggestions are directed to either the SFAC or to one of the attorneys who helps with standard forms.  If you have questions or concerns about the SDAR forms library, please </span>
