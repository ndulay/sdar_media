        <span class="">By Skip Walker, MCI, ACI Nearly 95% of California famil living on the brink of a tragedy this isn't what you are probably ing.  I am not talking about an quake.  It is the smoke alarm most of us depend on in a fire most, I always believed that alarms were pretty much all the After all, every smoke alarm sold is required to be tested and app The smoke alarms most of us h home are either ionization or electric type alarms.  The reality all smoke alarms are not the In real-world fires, these two of alarms will react very diffe In this case, different is not Knowing the difference could well save your life. Back in the 1970's, smoke were largely unknown.  Back the residential fire death rate was 7 to 8 fatalities per 1,000 U.S. fires.  Between the ’70s and no have installed hundreds of m of smoke alarms in U.S. homes.  Yet today, your chances of dying in a fire still hover around 7 or 8 deaths per 1,000 home fires.  Clearly, something is terribly wrong here. </span>

      <p>
        <span class="">The problem with ionization alarms isn't just the their slow response times.  Ionization alarms nuisance trip when you cook, shower, etc.  People become frustrated and intentional-ly disable them, leaving their fam-ily completely unprotected.  About 2/3's of all residential fire deaths </span>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <span class="">alarms had no batteries,   none of the functional alarms responded, all were ionization alarms.  Dean and Doug founded “Fathers for Fire Safety” as a way to educate the public and fire service about this critical issue. This group works closely with the World Fire Safety Foundation, an organiza-tion that has been instrumental in educating the fire service community and general public about this critical issue. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">There is significant university and government research – some going back to the mid-1970s -   clearly showing that ionization alarms are slow to react in smoldering fires.  It has taken decades, but there is finally a growing public awareness of this issue.  Recently, the International Association of Firefighters (IAFF) took a stand and now recommends that only photoelectric smoke alarms be installed.  In July, 2010, the City of Albany, California, became the first city in California to require photo-electric smoke alarms in new con-struction and remodels.  In late 2010, the cities of Palo Alto and Orange enacted ordinances requiring pho-toelectric technology alarms.  In January 2011, the City of Sebastopol enacted an ordinance requiring pho-toelectric technology. Both Vermont and Massachusetts now require pho-toelectric technology smoke alarms in residential construction. Hopefully, California will step up and join Vermont and Massachusetts in requir-ing photoelectric technology alarms at the state level.                                          Albany Fire Chief Marc McGinn has called for, the immediate removal of the fraudulent, deadly, ionization so-called smoke alarms from all stores and homes before more people are needlessly maimed or killed.” </span>

      <p>
        <span class="">Which Ones Do I Have? It is not always possible to know. In general, if the alarm has a “Hush” feature, it probably an ionization unit. If the label says anything about radio-active material, Americium-241 or the model number has an “I” in it - then it is </span>

        <span class="">probably an ionization alarm.  If there </span>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <span class="">ping.  There are design issues with cer-tain combination alarms that actually make them less effective than photo-electric only alarms.  The International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF) spe-cifically recommends against install-ing combination alarms. There are also combination photo-electric/carbon monoxide (CO) alarms. For safety reasons, smoke alarms should be replaced every 10 years.  CO detectors should be replaced every 5 to 7 years.  With combination units, you are either replacing the smoke alarm portion too soon or relying on a CO detector that is past its replace-ment date.  Combo units are also more expensive. Separate units make more sense. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Every year, about 1,000 people die needlessly in residential fires and thousands more are seriously injured. It is critical that public awareness of this issue become the top priority for each of us.  Photoelectric alarms pro-vide the best protection in real-world fires that we have available today.  And they cost only a few dollars more.  This year, don't just replace your smoke alarm batteries – replace your alarms with photoelectric alarms and recom-mend that your families, friends, and neighbors all do the same.
